    	    <p> I am a passionate leader who has devoted my life to building community connections and supporting others through innovation. In my work experience I have taken on many different roles to expand my leadership skills and passion for helping others. From working in a call center to helping food stamp recipients in crisis to directing a national nonprofit to positively impact a community of over 6 million youth in LGBTQ+ families, my skills and passions grew exponentially and I have had to learn how to become a jack-of-all-trades. Above all else, a few of my skills have been sought after and utilized: my drive for innovation, my innate skill for relationship building, my creative problem-solving skills, my passion for working with others, and my vision for building efficient and effective systems with a focus on the user experience. From my experiences and passions, I have launched myself into the tech industry and am eager to find my place within it. As a passionate learner with a history of rising to any occasion, I know the tech industry will be a great fit for me to continue to grow and develop my skills to make an impact and help others.</p>
